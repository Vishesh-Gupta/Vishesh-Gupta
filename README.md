### About Me

I'm a Software Engineer, with a focus on Infrastructure and Site Reliability Engineering. Currently working at @ClearStreet to enhance scalability of modern financial solutions. I enjoy working on complex and challenging problems.

I am an avid traveller, and have visited 8 countries so far. I know this might sound a lot less but I did fly 100,000 kms in 2023. 

I love watching anime, eating food and dressing well. In future, I want to build my own clothing store and restaurant.
